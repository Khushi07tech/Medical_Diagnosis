An intelligent symptom-based diagnosis system built with Python and OOP principles.

## Author
Khushbakht Irfan - Bridging Medicine and Technology

## Project Background
As someone transitioning from pre-med to computer science, I built this system to address healthcare accessibility challenges. This tool helps users get preliminary diagnosis suggestions based on their symptoms, particularly useful in underserved areas where immediate medical consultation isn't available.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This is an educational project and should NOT replace professional medical advice. Always consult a qualified healthcare provider for medical concerns.
